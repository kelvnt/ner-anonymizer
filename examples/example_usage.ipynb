    "DataAnonymizer handles anonymization in free text columns by using named entity recognition (NER) with a pretrained mdoel from the [transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) package to pick up entities such as location and person, generate a MD5 hash for the entity, replaces the entity with the hash, and stores the hash to entity in a dictionary for de-anonymization. A similar process is repeated for categorical columns, without the use of NER.\n",
